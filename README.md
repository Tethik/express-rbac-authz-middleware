# README

Work in progress. A simple RBAC Authorization middleware for Express. Written in typescript
for all your code autocompletion needs.

```
npm i --save express-rbac-authz-middleware
```

```js
import { AuthzMiddleware } from 'express-rbac-authz-middleware';
```


## Sample usage
```js
import { AuthzMiddleware } from 'express-rbac-authz-middleware';

const app = express()

const options = {
tokenDecoder: (req) => ({
    id: '123',
    roles: ['user']
})
}

app.use(AuthzMiddleware(options))
app.get('/user', (req, resp) => {
    req.authz.all('user')
    resp.json({ msg: 'Hello User' })    
})
app.get('/admin', (req, resp) => {
    req.authz.is('admin') // throws AuthzError
    resp.json({ msg: 'Hello Admin' })    
})
app.get('/guest', (req, resp) => {    
    resp.json({ msg: 'Hello Guest' })    
})
```

## Setup

In your express app:
```js
const options = {
tokenDecoder: (req) => ({
    id: '123',
    roles: ['user']
})
}

app.use(AuthzMiddleware(options))
```

## API
The API is exposed on the Express Request interface via the `authz` property. 

It has the following functions which you can use to assert authorization rules:
`is`,`all`,`any`

On authorization failure, e.g. a token with roles `[user]` trying to access a resource protected by `req.auth.is("admin")`, the function throws an `AuthzError`. If you want to use a boolean interface instead, you can use the `auth.checks` methods. These are the same predicates
as above but they return booleans as result instead of throwing an error.

### Roles as an enum
Alternatively you don't have to use strings as your roles. Here's an example using enums:

```ts
  enum Roles {
    Admin = 1,
    User = 2,
    Support = 3
  }

  const options: AuthzMiddlewareOptions = {
    tokenDecoder: req => ({
      id: '123',
      roles: [Roles.Admin, Roles.Support]
    })
  }
```

Then later in your route you could do the following:
```ts
app.get('/admin', (req, resp) => {
    req.authz.is(Roles.Admin)
    resp.json({ msg: 'Hello Admin' })
})
```










<!-- You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import myLib from 'mylib'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import something from 'mylib/dist/lib/something'
``` -->
